# Embracing Change: My Journey from Sociology to Computer Science

![an unsplash pic of a way](/images/blog/first.jpg)

A year and a half ago, I found myself at a crossroads after graduating in sociology and education. As much as I cherished the knowledge I gained from my previous degree, I couldn't ignore the stirring curiosity and longing for something more. The allure of self-interpretation and the promise of a whole new world to uncover led me to embark on a transformative journey into the realm of Computer Science.

## The Boot Camp Experience: A Glimpse of Tech's Wonders

Before officially starting my studies, I decided to take a half-year boot camp with OpenCampus to dip my toes into the tech waters. Little did I know that this experience would only fuel my passion further. During those intensive months, I dived into Frontend Development and discovered the perfect fusion of creativity and problem-solving.

## Onward to Year Two: The Right Path Revealed

A year and a half later, as I approach the second year of my Computer Science studies, I can confidently say that I'm on the right path. The decision to switch from sociology to Computer Science has been nothing short of life-changing.

The learning process has been a rollercoaster ride, challenging me to push my limits and expand my horizons. From mastering the intricacies of algorithms to collaborating on innovative projects with like-minded individuals, every step has been a stepping stone towards my personal growth.

## A Supportive Community: Mentors and Friends Along the Way

The supportive community I found within the Computer Science realm has been a blessing. I've been fortunate to have mentors who have guided me through the complexities of this field and friends who share the same enthusiasm for technological marvels.

With each passing day, I feel a deeper connection to this ever-evolving field. My journey from sociology and education to Computer Science has been a profound revelation of my true calling. I'm grateful for every experience that has shaped me and every challenge that has honed my skills.

As I look ahead to the next chapter of my adventure, I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude. The decision to embrace Computer Science has not only gifted me with a new career path but also a newfound sense of purpose and fulfillment.

To everyone who has been a part of my journey so far, thank you for your support, encouragement, and camaraderie. I'm excited to continue sharing my experiences, discoveries, and achievements with all of you as I navigate through the captivating world of Computer Science.

Here's to embracing change, chasing dreams, and continuing this exhilarating journey together! ðŸ˜Š
