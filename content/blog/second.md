## Discovering a New Path

A little over a year ago, I took a leap of faith and ventured into the world of Computer Science. As someone who wasn't particularly fond of math, it seemed like a daunting endeavor. However, my curiosity for technology led me forward, and I couldn't be more grateful for the experiences that followed.

## Triumph over Math Fears

To my surprise and delight, I found success in my coursework, even with the math components. It was a confidence boost to see that I could overcome my fear and excel in the subject that once troubled me.

## Embracing the Challenges

The first year of Computer Science brought countless assignments and long hours of dedication. Yet, each challenge was met with a sense of joy and fulfillment. The process of coding and problem-solving became an enjoyable puzzle to unravel.

## From Simple App to Something More

During the year, I had the pleasure of working on a Tic Tac Toe app using vanilla JavaScript. It was a gratifying experience to turn a simple game into a functional application. Building on that foundation, I further explored the Solid Start framework to expand the app's potential, making it a Tic Tac Toe Hub. The process was a learning curve, but the excitement of seeing it come together made it worthwhile.

## Unveiling a Passion for AI

As I delved deeper into my studies, I found myself drawn to the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. The possibilities of AI amazed me, and I decided to make it my main focus. Machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks have become areas I'm eager to explore further.

## Grateful for the Journey, Hopeful for the Future

Looking back on my first year, I feel a sense of gratitude for the growth and opportunities that Computer Science has provided. Overcoming my math aversion and embracing AI as a passion has been an unexpected but fulfilling journey.

As I continue in this field, I approach the challenges with a sense of optimism and a desire to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. I'm excited for what the future holds and can't wait to share more updates as I explore the exciting realms of AI.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope you'll stay tuned for more adventures ahead! ðŸ˜Š
