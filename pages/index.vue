        <p>Hi there! ðŸŒž</p>
        <p>
          I'm a 26-year-old with a penchant for exploring life's twists and
          turns, embracing every experience with open arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, I studied sociology and education, but a serendipitous
          encounter led me to a new passion -
          <span class="font-bold text-[#00cc66]">computer science</span>. It's
          been an intriguing journey so far, from a bootcamp course to diving
          into Computer Science studies, where I recently wrapped up my first
          year and look forward to the next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm working as a working student at a Software Dev Company,
          gaining valuable insights and building my expertise in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Home is in the picturesque city of Kiel, where I've found solace and
          joy in various sports, especially
          <span class="font-bold text-[#00cc66]">water sports</span>. Among
          them, rowing holds a special place in my heart, and it's a delight to
          share that joy with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a brief glimpse into my life's tapestry. I hope you'll join me
          as I continue exploring, learning, and making the most of this
          beautiful journey we call life. Thanks for stopping by!
        </p>
